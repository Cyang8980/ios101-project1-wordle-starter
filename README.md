# Project 1 - *iOS Wordle*

Submitted by: **Calvin Yang**

**iOS Wordle** is an app that randomly chooses a four letter word for the player to guess. Everytime the correct letter is guessed, it is shown as yellow (if it isn't in the correct spot). If the letter is in the correct spot in the word, it is shown as green. After all the letters are guessed correctly, all the letters are now green and you have won.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I was a bit lost when I was looking at Exercise 6, it said to set the style to `initial` but I didn't make the set(style: ) function yet. I skipped it until I actually made the set(style: ) function but even using it was a bit weird since I wasn't used to the syntax. I kept trying set(style: 'initial') or set(style: initial). Both of which had XCode yelling at me.
